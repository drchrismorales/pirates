    '''
    A combat encounter with a troop of man eating monkies.
    When the event is drawn, creates a combat encounter with 4 to 8 monkies, kicks control over to the combat code to resolve the fight.
    The monkies are "edible", which is modeled by increasing the ship's food by 3 per monkey appearing and adding an apropriate message to the result.
        Since food is good, the event only has a 50% chance to add itself to the result.
